Regular expressions (often abbreviated as regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for working with text. 
They are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, which can then be used to match, locate, or replace parts of text. 
Regular expressions are widely used in programming for tasks like data validation, scraping, parsing, and more.

Basic Components of Regular Expressions
Literals: The most basic type of regular expression, it matches the exact text.

Example: apple will match "apple" in "I have an apple."
Character Classes: Enclosed in square brackets [], these match any one of the enclosed characters.

Example: [aeiou] will match any vowel in "Hello."
Quantifiers: These specify how many instances of the preceding element to match.

* : 0 or more
+ : 1 or more
? : 0 or 1
{n} : exactly n
{n,} : n or more
{n,m} : between n and m
Anchors: These specify the position of the match.

^ : start of string
$ : end of string
Special Characters: Some characters have special meanings, like ., *, +, ?, |, (), [], {}, and ^. To use them literally, you have to escape them with a backslash \.

Groups and Capturing: Enclosed in parentheses (), groups allow you to apply quantifiers to multiple elements, or capture parts of the matched text.

Alternation: The | symbol allows you to match either the preceding or following pattern.

Escape Sequences: Special sequences that start with a backslash \ and represent predefined sets of characters. 
For example, \d matches any digit, \w matches any alphanumeric character, and \s matches any whitespace.
